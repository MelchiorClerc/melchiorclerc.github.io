# About me... 

PhD candidate, very fortunate to be supervised by Lata Gangadharan, Pushkar Maitra & Paulo Santos and previously by Yaping Shan when at Adelaide Uni.

<br><br>
## Past work:

[Peer Monitoring & Islamic Microfinance](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2021.02.001), with Yaping Shan & Mandar Oak. JEBO 2021.

In brief, we explore Shariâ€™ah compliant, profit-loss-sharing microfinance contracts. We show that these contracts offer better insurance for borrowers, but also increase incentives for strategic default. We then introduce a novel mechanism to limit strategic default. This mechanism is joint liability in truthfully reporting realised profits as a way for the MFI to leverage private (local) information. When local knowledge is sufficiently high, we show PLS contracts, with our new mechanism, can outperform interest-bearing loans.

## Current work:
<em>First chapter: On the Origins of Misogyny.</em> Cameron, Gangadaran, Maitra and Santos.

We gather a large dataset of potential, exogenous historical determinants of contemporary misogyny (preference for gender equality) and use machine learning techniques to identify those which best explain misogyny. Once these are identified, we explain why these are the most important. Working paper available on request, really, ask, we'd love feedback.

<em>Second chapter: Inequality Aversion & Crowding Out.</em> Cameron, Gangadaran, Maitra, Santos & Joe Vecci 	

We conducted a large, cross country online experiment in September through December 2022. Within treatments, we varied inequality levels between subjects. Across treatments we varied the way experimental income was redistributed between the rich and poor. Then, in an extended dictator game, we find no crowding out of either pro- or anti- social payments between subjects, irrespective of country, or of redistribution policy. Structural estimates show inequality aversion does not differ between treatments, likely explaining why we see no crowding out. Working paper available on request

<em>Third chapter: Risk Preferences and Chess.</em> Romain Viry, Daivd Smerdon and Pushkar Maitra. 

We create a new, more granular measure of risk based on opening moves players make in chess games. We use millions of games across decades and numerous countries. Using FIDE identifiers, we track individual players across their careers and control for ability. We plot risk preferences across the lifecycle, and across time and space.
