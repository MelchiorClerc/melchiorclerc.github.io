Econ and academia more generally is known to be a place where sexual misconduct goes unpunished. My hope is that creeps, a package still very much in beta, is a small contribution to combatting this trend. It allows latex-users to quickly identify authors in their .bib files who have been sanctioned for sexual misconduct by their institution.\\
<br><br>

tldr; here's a [minimum working example](https://www.overleaf.com/project/65916a0c9f98ad02ee07be00).\\
<br><br>

**Expected behaviour**

If you do not cite someone who is matched to an individual in the database, **nothing will happen**. If an author is matched to someone in the database, a message will be printed, showing you who it is, which articles you're citing in which they're an author, and a link to the case.\\
<br><br>

**Installation**

Currently, only available on overleaf, see installation details on [github](https://github.com/alistaircameron/creeps).
