				<p>    Would love to think of myself as a development economist, and maybe one day that's what I'll be, but read on, and you'll find out that I'm not doing work that can be thought of as a "typical" development job-market paper.
          <br><br> Currently visiting GATE lab and really loving it. At GATE, and Europe more broadly, there's a large number of really strong phd candidates and friendly post-docs, kind of intimidating coming from a small pond...  
          <br><br>
Would love to stay on in France for a while, so unashamadly willing to take up postdocs anywhere in the hexagon!</a></p>
