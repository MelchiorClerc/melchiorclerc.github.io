					Applied microeconomist.

				<p>    Would love to think of myself as a development economist, and maybe one day that's what I'll be, but read on, and you'll find out that I'm not doing a typical development job-market paper.
          <br><br> Monash Uni phd candidate. Currently visiting GATE lab and really loving it. At GATE, and Europe more broadly, there's a large number of really strong phd candidates and friendly post-docs, kind of intimidating coming from a small pond...  
          <br><br>
Would love to stay on in France for a while, so <b>unashamadly willing to take up postdocs anywhere in the hexagon.</b> And, if it's something with a development focus and the possibility of fieldwork, it's a snap-call!</a></p>
