				<p>    Monash Uni phd candidate. Currently visiting GATE lab and really loving it. At GATE, and Europe more broadly, there's a large number of really strong phd candidates and friendly post-docs, kind of intimidating coming from a small pond...  
          <br><br>
Would love to stay on in Europe (preferably France) for a while, so seeking postdocs in the hexagon. A development focus would be a bonus.
